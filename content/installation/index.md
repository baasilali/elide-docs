# Installation

Install Elide once to unlock every supported language runtime. Follow these steps to set up a workstation or CI runner.

## Prerequisites

- A Unix-like environment (macOS, Linux, or WSL2 on Windows)
- Bun `^1.0` for local tooling
- Git for version control

## Install the CLI

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.elide.sh | sh
```

The installer adds the `elide` binary to your path. Verify the installation:

```bash
elide --version
```

## Editor integrations

Install the Elide language server extension for your editor of choice. The VS Code marketplace listing is published under `elide-dev.elide`.

## Next steps

Once the tooling is installed, continue with the [Getting Started guide](/getting-started/).
