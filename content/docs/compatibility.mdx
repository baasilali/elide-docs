# Compatibility

Overview of language compatibility and standards supported by Elide.

## Language Support Matrix

| Language | Stability | Elide's Engine | Stock Engine | Notes |
|----------|-----------|----------------|--------------|-------|
| JavaScript | beta | GraalJs | V8 | ECMA2024-compatible. Node API compat pending. |
| TypeScript | beta | OXC | TSC | |
| WebAssembly | beta | GraalWasm | V8 | |
| Python | beta | GraalPython | CPython | Roughly ~85% compatible with PyPI top 1000. See here. |
| Pkl | beta | Apple Pkl | Apple Pkl | |
| Ruby | alpha | TruffleRuby | MRI | Passes ~97% of ruby/spec. See here. |
| LLVM | experimental | Sulong | LLVM Runtime | |

## JavaScript & TypeScript

### ECMAScript Support (ES2024+)

Elide provides full support for modern ECMAScript features including classes, modules, async/await, destructuring, template literals, arrow functions, promises, generators, proxies, BigInt, optional chaining, nullish coalescing, and top-level await.

**TypeScript**: Version 5.0+ with native compilation support and all language features.

### API Compatibility

| API Category | Module | Support |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| Node.js | `fs`, `path`, `http`, `crypto`, `buffer`, `stream`, `process`, `console` | Full |
| Web | `fetch`, `URL`, `URLSearchParams`, `TextEncoder/Decoder`, `WebSocket`, `FormData`, `Headers`, `Request/Response` | Full |

## Python

**Version**: 3.11+ (CPython-compatible)

### Standard Library

| Module Category | Modules | Support |
|----------------|---------|---------|
| System | `os`, `sys`, `pathlib` | Full |
| Data | `json`, `csv`, `xml` | Full |
| Text & Time | `re`, `datetime`, `time` | Full |
| Collections | `collections`, `itertools` | Full |
| Math | `math`, `random`, `statistics` | Full |
| Network | `urllib`, `http.client` | Full |
| Concurrency | `threading`, `multiprocessing` | Limited |

### Third-Party Packages

| Package | Support |
|---------|---------|
| NumPy | Full |
| Pandas | Full |
| Requests | Full |
| Flask | Partial |
| Django | Not yet |

## Ruby

**Version**: 3.2+ (MRI-compatible)

Includes support for core classes (String, Array, Hash), file I/O, JSON/YAML parsing, regular expressions. C extensions have limited support.

## WebAssembly

**WASI**: Preview 1 with memory management, file system access, and environment variables.

**Supported Source Languages**: Rust, C/C++, AssemblyScript, Go (TinyGo)

## Pkl

Full support for the Pkl configuration language including all language features, native integration, type checking, and module imports.

## Feature Support Matrix

| Feature | JavaScript | Python | Ruby | WASM |
|---------|-----------|--------|------|------|
| File I/O | Full | Full | Full | Full |
| HTTP Client | Full | Full | Full | Partial |
| HTTP Server | Full | Full | Full | No |
| Async/Await | Full | Full | Partial | Partial |
| Polyglot Calls | Full | Full | Full | Partial |
| Native Extensions | Partial | Partial | Partial | N/A |

## Known Limitations

### Cross-Language

- Native extensions for C/C++ have limited support
- Threading features may have platform-specific limitations
- Java Native Interface (JNI) unavailable in native image builds

### JavaScript

- Some npm packages with native dependencies may require workarounds
- Modules `child_process` and `cluster` have functional limitations

### Python

- Pure Python implementations preferred over C extensions
- Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) may impact multi-threaded performance
- Some pip packages require additional configuration

## Migration Guide

### From Node.js

Update CommonJS imports to ES modules:

```javascript
// Before
const fs = require('fs')

// After
import fs from 'fs'
```

### From CPython

Most Python code runs without modification:

```python
import json

data = {'key': 'value'}
print(json.dumps(data))
```

### Feature Detection

```javascript
if (typeof fetch === 'function') {
  // Fetch API available
}

if (typeof Worker === 'function') {
  // Web Workers available
}
```
