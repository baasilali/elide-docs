# Environment Variables

Reading environment variables from JavaScript and Python

This exercise is part of the Polyglot 101 intro guide.

Many applications use [environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) to pass small bits of data between invocations, or across process boundaries.

As part of Elide's job in unifying multiple languages for use in one program, environment variable access is made uniform across all languages:

- **Environment is subject to policy.** By default, code **cannot see system environment variables** in Elide; this is a big difference with other runtimes, so it bears repeating below.

- **Environment is loaded uniformly.** Support for features like [dotenv files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68267862/what-is-an-env-or-dotenv-file-exactly) is cross-language in Elide. If you see a variable in JavaScript, you will see it as well in Python, Ruby, and so on.

<Alert>
  <strong>Note:</strong> With Elide, system environment variables are <strong>invisible by default</strong> to running code. You can allow access to environment using command line flags.
</Alert>

## Before you start

Before running the code below, you'll need to make sure the following is true:

- Elide is installed
- The `elide` binary is executable
- The `elide` binary is on your `PATH`, or otherwise referenced in absolute form

## Reading environment variables

We're going to try out Elide's policies with regard to **reading host environment variables.**

1. Start an interactive session; Elide defaults to JavaScript, so you should get a JavaScript prompt:

```bash
export ELIDE_TESTING="hello"
elide repl
elide (js) >
```

Use `Ctrl+C` twice or `Ctrl+D` to exit the interactive session.

2. Elide provides the [`process`](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process) object, just like Node:

```bash
elide (js) > process.env.ELIDE_TESTING
undefined
```

Our `ELIDE_TESTING` environment variable isn't showing up! That's because Elide forbids access to environment variables by default.

3. Now, let's run the REPL session again, but with access to host environment:

```bash
elide repl --allow:host-env
elide (js) > process.env.ELIDE_TESTING
hello
```

Neat! We can see the environment variable.

4. Now let's try Python:

```python
elide repl --python
elide (python) > import os; os.environ
Environ(ELIDE_INTERNAL, ELIDE_ROOT, NODE_ENV)
```

Elide provides the `NODE_ENV` variable to all languages, set to either `'development'` or `'production'`.

5. And with environment access enabled:

```python
elide repl --python --allow:host-env
elide (python) > import os; os.environ
Environ(ANDROID_HOME, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, ... ELIDE_TESTING, ...)
```

Of course, the accessing variable returns the expected value:

```python
elide repl --python --allow:host-env
elide (python) > import os; os.environ["ELIDE_TESTING"]
'hello'
```

## What you've learned

In this tutorial, you learned about Elide's policy enforcement around env variable access, and how it interoperates with JavaScript and Python.
