# Elide Runtime

Learn about the core runtime architecture and how Elide executes your code.

## Overview

The Elide runtime is built on GraalVM and provides:

- **Multi-language support** - JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Ruby, and more
- **Native compilation** - Compile to native binaries with GraalVM Native Image
- **Polyglot interop** - Seamlessly call between languages
- **Modern APIs** - Web-standard APIs like Fetch, crypto, and more

## Runtime Architecture

Elide consists of several layers:

### Core Runtime
The foundation that handles:
- Script execution
- Memory management
- Module resolution
- Sandboxing

### Language Engines
Specialized engines for each supported language:
- JavaScript/TypeScript (GraalJS)
- Python (GraalPy)
- Ruby (TruffleRuby)
- WebAssembly

### Built-in APIs
Standard APIs available to all languages:
- HTTP client (Fetch API)
- File system operations
- Cryptography
- Console and logging

## Performance

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **JIT Compilation** | Fast execution after warmup |
| **Native Image** | Instant startup, low memory |
| **Polyglot Optimization** | Shared runtime between languages |
