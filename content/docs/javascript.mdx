# JavaScript

Elide can execute JavaScript, just like Node.js, Deno, or Bun. Similar to other popular JavaScript runtimes, Elide strives for Node API compatibility.

```bash
elide run --javascript ...
```

```javascript
export default function hello() {
  console.log("Elide can run JavaScript!")
}
```

## Language Engine

Elide is an ECMA2024-compliant JavaScript engine. JS is the most mature language offered by Elide; execution is powered by [GraalJs](https://github.com/oracle/graaljs), which ships with GraalVM.

## Standards Conformance

Elide conforms to several JavaScript standards.

### WinterTC

Elide is a [WinterTC](https://wintertc.org)-conforming runtime. Elide supports the [Minimum Common API](https://min-common-api.proposal.wintertc.org/) and several other WinterTC proposals or standards.

See our [WinterTC Conformance](https://docs.elide.dev/docs/wintertc) page for more information.

### Node API

The [Node API](https://nodejs.org/api) constitutes the functions and modules provided by Node.js on top of V8. The Node API is quite large and covers everything from assertion testing to zlib compression.

Elide aims for full Node API compatibility where possible and applicable. Elide is written on top of [GraalVM](https://graalvm.org) rather than V8, so immediately several Node API modules do not apply (for example, the `v8` module).

Most Node.js applications and libraries only make use of a small surface area of the Node API. As [Bun](https://bun.sh) and [Deno](https://deno.land) have shown, a great deal of software can run out of the box with sufficient but incomplete Node API coverage.

## Performance

Elide executes JavaScript with comparable performance to V8-based runtimes like Node and Deno, and JSC runtimes like Bun. Although GraalVM is a completely different core engine, it is well suited for CLI and server use, whereas V8 and JSC were architected with browsers in mind.

As a result, Elide can deliver very strong performance in JavaScript, especially for server-side use cases.

**Elide is ranked highly on the [TechEmpower benchmarks](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#hw=ph&test=plaintext&section=data-r23).** At the time of this writing, Elide holds the **133rd position** for plaintext responses. Node & Deno, FastAPI & Django (Python), and many other popular frameworks rank lower than this score.

| Tech Stack | TechEmpower Rank | Typical RPS | Warm Hit Latency | Cold Start Latency |
|------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Elide + JavaScript | 133 | ~800,000+ | ~3ms | ~30ms |
| Deno | 184 | ~200,000 | ~70ms | ~15ms |
| Node.js + Express | 364 | - | ~550ms | ~10ms |
| FastAPI + Python | 292 | - | ~30ms | - |
| Django + Python | 388 | - | ~65ms | - |
| Node.js + Next.js | 497 | ~3,000 | ~700ms | - |

All scores are selected from the first (highest performing) benchmark for a given framework. All numbers shown were measured on modern Linux x86-64.

## Glossary

**JavaScript**: A high-level programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
<br/>

**Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime designed primarily for server-side use. Node.js embeds Google's V8 JavaScript engine, the same available in Google Chrome.
<br/>

**Node API**: Suite of APIs provided on top of regular JavaScript, which collectively become Node.js. For example, if you've ever imported or required the `fs` or `path` module, you've used the Node API.
<br/>

**ECMAScript**: Formal name for JavaScript, as defined by the ECMAScript Standard. JavaScript language versions are denoted as ECMA years; for example, ECMA2024 includes JavaScript features up to the year 2024.
