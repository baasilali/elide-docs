# Welcome to Elide

Elide is a high-performance polyglot runtime built on GraalVM that lets you run JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and JVM languages in a single application with native-image compilation for instant startup times and minimal memory footprint.

<Alert>
  <strong>What makes Elide special?</strong> Unlike traditional runtimes, Elide can compile your entire application—including dependencies—into a single native binary that starts in milliseconds and uses a fraction of the memory.
</Alert>

## What is Elide?

Elide combines the best of multiple worlds:

- **Polyglot Runtime**: Run multiple languages in a single application with seamless interoperability
- **Native Compilation**: Compile to native binaries for instant startup (< 10ms) and low memory usage
- **Built-in HTTP Server**: High-performance server powered by Netty (800K+ req/s on Linux)
- **Modern APIs**: Clean, standards-based APIs similar to Deno and Bun
- **GraalVM Foundation**: Built on battle-tested GraalVM technology for optimal performance

## Quick Example

Here's a simple HTTP server in Elide:

```javascript
// server.js
const app = Elide.http

app.router.handle("GET", "/", (request, response) => {
  response.send(200, "Hello, Elide!")
})

app.router.handle("GET", "/api/data", (request, response) => {
  response.json({
    message: "Fast polyglot runtime",
    timestamp: Date.now()
  })
})
```

Run it:

```bash
elide run server.js
```

Compile to native binary:

```bash
elide build --native
```

This creates a standalone binary with no runtime dependencies!

## Performance Characteristics

| Metric | Elide (Native) | Node.js | Deno |
|--------|----------------|---------|------|
| **Cold Start** | ~5ms | ~500ms | ~100ms |
| **Memory (Hello World)** | ~10MB | ~50MB | ~40MB |
| **HTTP Throughput** | 800K+ req/s | 200K req/s | 300K req/s |
| **Binary Size** | ~15MB | N/A | ~90MB |

## Why Choose Elide?

### For Web Applications
- Ultra-fast server-side rendering (SSR)
- Minimal resource usage for cost savings
- Single binary deployment
- Built-in HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 support

### For Microservices

- High throughput HTTP server
- Native image packaging
- Cross-language service composition

### For CLI Tools
- Fast startup makes CLI tools snappy
- No runtime installation required
- Single binary distribution
- Cross-platform support

### For Serverless Functions
- Sub-10ms cold starts eliminate warmup
- Minimal memory reduces costs
- Native binaries work everywhere
- No container overhead

## Elide as a Framework

Elide isn't just a runtime—it's also a modern framework with modular components:

| Module | Description | Platforms |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| `core` | Essential utilities and APIs | JVM, JavaScript, Native, WASM |
| `base` | Extended functionality | JVM, JavaScript, Native |
| `server` | HTTP server and routing | JVM, Native Image |
| `ssr` | Server-side rendering | JVM, JavaScript |
| `graalvm` | GraalVM integration | JVM, Native Image |

Choose only the modules you need—everything works together seamlessly.

## Language Support

### JavaScript/TypeScript
