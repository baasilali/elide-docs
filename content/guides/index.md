# Guides by Language

The guides in this section document language-specific adapters, runtime behaviors, and interoperability notes. Each language directory mirrors the structure of the SDK it describes.

## How guides are structured

- **Adapter overview** explains how the runtime boots the language.
- **API reference** enumerates the surface area exposed to that language.
- **Recipes** demonstrate cross-language patterns.

We currently ship a comprehensive JavaScript guide with coverage for the Node API. Additional languages follow the same layout as they become available.
